 crushtool -- CRUSH map manipulation tool
==========================================

.. program:: crushtool

Synopsis
========

| **crushtool** ( -d *map* | -c *map.txt* | --build --num_osds *numosds*
  *layer1* *...* ) [ -o *outfile* ]


Description
===========

**crushtool** is a utility that lets you create, compile, and
decompile CRUSH map files.

CRUSH is a pseudo-random data distribution algorithm that efficiently
maps input values (typically data objects) across a heterogeneous,
hierarchically structured device map. The algorithm was originally
described in detail in the following paper (although it has evolved
some since then):

       http://www.ssrc.ucsc.edu/Papers/weil-sc06.pdf

The tool has four modes of operation.

.. option:: -c map.txt

   will compile a plaintext map.txt into a binary map file.

.. option:: -d map

   will take the compiled map and decompile it into a plaintext source
   file, suitable for editing.

.. option:: --build --num_osds {num-osds} layer1 ...

   will create a relatively generic map with the given layer
   structure. See below for examples.

.. option:: --test

   will perform a dry run of a CRUSH mapping for a range of input object 
   names, see crushtool --help for more information.
   

Options
=======

.. option:: -o outfile

   will specify the output file.

	

Building a map
==============

The build mode will generate relatively generic hierarchical maps. The
first argument simply specifies the number of devices (leaves) in the
CRUSH hierarchy. Each layer describes how the layer (or raw devices)
preceding it should be grouped.

Each layer consists of::

       name ( uniform | list | tree | straw ) size

The first element is the name for the elements in the layer
(e.g. "rack"). Each element's name will be append a number to the
provided name.

The second component is the type of CRUSH bucket.

The third component is the maximum size of the bucket. If the size is
0, a single bucket will be generated that includes everything in the
preceding layer.


Example
=======

Suppose we have two rows with two racks each and 20 nodes per rack. Suppose
each node contains 4 storage devices for Ceph OSD Daemons. This configuration
allows us to deploy 320 Ceph OSD Daemons. Lets assume a 42U rack with 2U nodes,
leaving an extra 2U for a rack switch.

To reflect our hierarchy of devices, nodes, racks and rows, we would execute
the following::

	crushtool -o crushmap --build --num_osds 320 node straw 4 rack straw 20 row straw 2

To adjust the default (generic) mapping rules, we can run::

       # decompile
       crushtool -d crushmap -o map.txt

       # edit
       vi map.txt

       # recompile
       crushtool -c map.txt -o crushmap


Availability
============

**crushtool** is part of the Ceph distributed file system. Please
refer to the Ceph documentation at http://ceph.com/docs for more
information.

===================================
 Installing Debian/Ubuntu Packages
===================================

You may install stable release packages (for stable deployments),
development release packages (for the latest features), or development
testing packages (for development and QA only).  Do not add multiple
package sources at the same time.

Install Release Key
===================

Packages are cryptographically signed with the ``release.asc`` key.
Add our release key to your system's list of trusted keys to avoid a
security warning::

	wget -q -O- 'https://ceph.com/git/?p=ceph.git;a=blob_plain;f=keys/release.asc' | sudo apt-key add -

Add Release Packages
====================


Dumpling
--------

Dumpling is the most recent major release of Ceph. These packages are
recommended for anyone deploying Ceph in a production environment.
Critical bug fixes are backported and point releases are made as
necessary.

Add our package repository to your system's list of APT sources.  
See `the dumpling Debian repository`_ for a complete list of Debian and Ubuntu releases
supported. ::

	echo deb http://ceph.com/debian-dumpling/ $(lsb_release -sc) main | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ceph.list

For the European users there is also a mirror in the Netherlands at http://eu.ceph.com/ ::

	echo deb http://eu.ceph.com/debian-dumpling/ $(lsb_release -sc) main | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ceph.list



Cuttlefish
----------

Cuttlefish is the previous major release of Ceph.  These packages are
recommended for those who have already deployed bobtail in production and are
not yet ready to upgrade.

Add our package repository to your system's list of APT sources.  
See `the cuttlefish Debian repository`_ for a complete list of Debian and Ubuntu releases
supported. ::

	echo deb http://ceph.com/debian-cuttlefish/ $(lsb_release -sc) main | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ceph.list

For the European users there is also a mirror in the Netherlands at http://eu.ceph.com/ ::

	echo deb http://eu.ceph.com/debian-cuttlefish/ $(lsb_release -sc) main | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ceph.list


Bobtail
-------

Bobtail is the second major release of Ceph. These packages are
recommended for those who have already deployed bobtail in production and
are not yet ready to upgrade.

Add our package repository to your system's list of APT sources.  
See `the bobtail Debian repository`_ for a complete list of Debian and Ubuntu releases
supported. ::

	echo deb http://ceph.com/debian-bobtail/ $(lsb_release -sc) main | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ceph.list

For the European users there is also a mirror in the Netherlands at http://eu.ceph.com/ ::

	echo deb http://eu.ceph.com/debian-bobtail/ $(lsb_release -sc) main | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ceph.list

Argonaut
--------

Argonaut is the first major release of Ceph.  These packages are
recommended for those who have already deployed Argonaut in production
and are not yet ready to upgrade.

Add our package repository to your system's list of APT sources.  See
`the argonaut Debian repository`_ for a complete list of Debian and Ubuntu releases
supported. ::

	echo deb http://ceph.com/debian-argonaut/ $(lsb_release -sc) main | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ceph.list

For the European users there is also a mirror in the Netherlands at http://eu.ceph.com/ ::

	echo deb http://eu.ceph.com/debian-argonaut/ $(lsb_release -sc) main | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ceph.list
 

Development Release Packages
----------------------------

Our development process generates a new release of Ceph every 3-4
weeks.  These packages are faster-moving than the stable releases, as
they get new features integrated quickly, while still undergoing
several weeks of QA prior to release.

Add our package repository to your system's list of APT sources.  See
`the testing Debian repository`_ for a complete list of Debian and Ubuntu releases
supported. ::

	echo deb http://ceph.com/debian-testing/ $(lsb_release -sc) main | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ceph.list

For the European users there is also a mirror in the Netherlands at http://eu.ceph.com/ ::

	echo deb http://eu.ceph.com/debian-testing/ $(lsb_release -sc) main | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ceph.list


Development Testing Packages
----------------------------

We automatically build Debian and Ubuntu packages for current
development branches in the Ceph source code repository.  These
packages are intended for developers and QA only.

Packages are cryptographically signed with the ``autobuild.asc`` key.
Add our autobuild key to your system's list of trusted keys to avoid a
security warning::

	wget -q -O- 'https://ceph.com/git/?p=ceph.git;a=blob_plain;f=keys/autobuild.asc' | sudo apt-key add -

Add our package repository to your system's list of APT sources, but
replace ``{BRANCH}`` with the branch you'd like to use (e.g., chef-3,
wip-hack, master, stable).  See `the gitbuilder page`_ for a complete
list of distributions we build. ::

	echo deb http://gitbuilder.ceph.com/ceph-deb-$(lsb_release -sc)-x86_64-basic/ref/{BRANCH} $(lsb_release -sc) main | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ceph.list


Installing Packages
===================

Once you have added either release or development packages to APT, 
you should update APT's database and install Ceph::

	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ceph

The Ceph Object Store is the foundation of all Ceph clusters, and it consists
primarily of two types of daemons: Object Storage Daemons (OSDs) and monitors.
The Ceph Object Store is based upon the concept of 
:abbr:`RADOS (Reliable Autonomic Distributed Object Store)`, which eliminates
single points of failure and delivers infinite scalability. For details on 
the architecture of Ceph and RADOS, refer to `Ceph Architecture`_. All Ceph
deployments have OSDs and monitors, so you should prepare your Ceph cluster
by focusing first on the object storage cluster.

To begin using Ceph in production, you should review our hardware
recommendations and operating system recommendations. Many of the
frequently-asked questions in our mailing list involve hardware-related
questions and how to install Ceph on various distributions.

If you are deploying a Ceph cluster (that is, not developing Ceph),
install Ceph using our stable release packages. For testing, you 
may install development release and testing packages.

You can build Ceph from source by downloading a release or cloning the ``ceph``
repository at github. If you intend to build Ceph from source, please see the
build pre-requisites first. Making sure you have all the pre-requisites
will save you time.
